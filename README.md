This project aim to build an Open-Sourced ECU (Engine Control Unit), fully programmable, accessible and modifiable, specificaly designed for motorcycles.
It's build around the DIY-EFI's CORE4 board, with a custom "Daughter board", and use the Speeduino firmware.
The CORE4 board is current choice for it's compact footprint, and fully featured board.

# Electronics and Hardware parts
As the CORE4 is kind of a "all-in-one" solution, this current project focuses around build a "Daughter board" to plug the CORE4.

The Kawasaki GPZ500 (from 1998) is used as the testing platform.
